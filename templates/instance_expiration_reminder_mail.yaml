subject: 'The instance {instance} is going to expire soon'
body: |
  Dear Openstack User,

  The instance "{instance}" that's running on your personal project
  in the Cloud Infrastructure Service is going to expire on "{expire_date}".

  If you don't need this machine anymore, please delete it so other customers can
  use the resources. If you still need it, you can extend the expiration of the machine
  in the OpenStack website.

  If you have any question or need any help, please don't hesitate to reach out
  through a ticket in ServiceNow.


  Thank you for your attention,

  Cheers,
  Cloud Infrastructure Team
